# Eulerian-Tour
 A graph G is called Eulerian if it is connected and the degree of every vertex is an even number. It is known that such graphs aways have a tour (a cycle that may not be simple) that goes through every edge of the graph exactly once. Such a tour (sometimes called a circuit) is called an Euler tour. If the graph is connected, and it has exactly 2 nodes of odd degree, then it has an Euler Path connecting these two nodes, that includes all the edges of the graph exactly once. In this project, a code that finds an Euler tour or an Euler Path in a given graph is written.
