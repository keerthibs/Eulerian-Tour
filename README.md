# Eulerian-Tour
 A graph G is called Eulerian if it is connected and the degree of every vertex is an even number. It is known that such graphs aways have a tour (a cycle that may not be simple) that goes through every edge of the graph exactly once. Such a tour (sometimes called a circuit) is called an Euler tour. If the graph is connected, and it has exactly 2 nodes of odd degree, then it has an Euler Path connecting these two nodes, that includes all the edges of the graph exactly once. In this project, a code that finds an Euler tour or an Euler Path in a given graph is written. 
 

1. EulerTrail.java
2. Vertex.java
3. Edge.java
4. Graph.java
5. Driver.java

EulerTrail.java contains the implementation of FindEulerTour method.
Vertex.java, Edge.java, Graph.java define the structure of Graph.
Driver.java is used to run the program.
